# Agent

Agent is an Online Classroom Management System but before that, it's my life's first web application project. I only did this for learning purpose. My group mates and I completed Agent in less than 6 months and presented it as our Capstone project.

Besides some common features that other Online Classroom Management Systems have, Agent has some new features. As the new features, it has grouping system inside a class, submission window with the end time and an advanced marksheet system.
